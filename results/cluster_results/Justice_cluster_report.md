### <span style="color:#1877F2"> Cluster Descriptions: 
Cluster 0 appears to focus on justice as a means of restoring rights to those who have had them taken away or denied. Major themes found in this cluster include the idea of justice as a means of ensuring that perpetrators of wrongdoing are held accountable, restoring material possessions, protecting religious beliefs and rights, and reclaiming rights that have been withheld. This cluster is differentiated from the other two clusters in that it focuses more on justice as a means of restoring rights and restoring the balance of power.

Cluster 1 appears to focus on understanding the concept of justice and the rights of the Yazidi people. Major themes found in this cluster include the lack of justice in Iraq and the Kurdistan region, the lack of protection and resources available to the Yazidi people, the lack of understanding of the concept of justice, and the need for international protection. This cluster is differentiated from the other two clusters in that it focuses more on understanding justice and the rights of the Yazidi people, rather than on justice as a means of restoring rights.

Cluster 2 appears to focus on justice as a means of punishing those responsible for violence and restoring rights taken away from the Yazidi people. Major themes found in this cluster include the need for retribution for wrongs that have been done, the need for protection for the Yazidi people, the need for legal and governmental authorities to uphold fair and equal rights, the need for equality between men and women, and the need to take matters into one's own hands in order to achieve justice. This cluster is differentiated from the other two clusters in that it focuses more on justice as a means of punishing perpetrators of violence and restoring rights taken away from the Yazidi people. </br></br>

They are unsure if there will be justice in Iraq in the future.', "R believes that justice is when there is no war and everyone gets their due rights.
