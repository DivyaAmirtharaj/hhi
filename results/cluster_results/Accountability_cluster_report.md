From my perspective, we should have responded in kind and given them the same treatment they gave us.', "From the respondent's perspective, it is very important that those responsible for any harm they have experienced be held accountable.

R believes that ISIS should be punished using the same methods they used on others, such as torture and suffering.", "From the respondent's perspective, it is extremely important that ISIS is punished for the wrongs they have committed. I feel like I have a lot of emotions and experiences that I can't express, and that even if I tried to explain them, it would take a long time and still not be enough.

R: I'm confused as to why someone would do something so heinous - killing all the villagers, kidnapping women and children. R: I believe that all individuals involved in ISIS, regardless of age, should be held accountable and prosecuted.

R feels that killing a single individual from Isis is not enough to make up for all the pain and suffering they have caused.

They also suggest that people should be made to feel the same pain that their victims and their families experienced.', 'From my perspective, it is very important to me to get revenge on ISIS. R: I have suffered greatly at the hands of the people responsible for these atrocities. My family has faced injury, loss of life and uncertainty, and my parents have been greatly affected.

From the perspective of the respondent, they experienced great suffering as a result of their family members being taken by a force or group, with two of their brothers having three children, one of whom was 20 years old. All of them were held captive and subjected to terrible conditions. R is unable to comprehend the question and is unable to answer it. R believes that those responsible for a wrongdoing should not be allowed to escape punishment and should be held accountable for their actions.', 'From my perspective, it is essential that anyone who commits violence be held accountable. R: I have seen firsthand how bad these people are and why it is important for me to stay away from them. They are violent and have killed people for simply speaking their minds. They cannot be trusted because they are prone to betrayal. They are all bad and should be avoided. The respondent has seen the soldiers and has been told multiple times why they were doing something, to which they responded that they were following orders from someone higher up. It is implied that the chief is the one responsible for this. From the perspective of the respondent, they believe that those in ISIS should be killed, rather than judged, as they have done nothing good and their opinion is not valued.', 'From my perspective, it is essential that anyone who commits violence be held accountable.

R: It is important to me that those who have committed violence are held accountable and that their victims are compensated for the harm done to them. From the respondent's perspective, there appears to be a difference between Isis fighters and commanders, with the commanders having a higher level of authority and the small ones following the orders given by the commanders. From the respondent's perspective, they believe that the only way to hold Isis members accountable is through the death penalty. They have not heard any reports of how the members have been punished so far. They suggest that if any Isis members are captured, the country should allow for them to be punished.", 'From the perspective of the respondent, it is very important that members of Isis be held accountable and judged in a court of law. From my perspective, it is important to take action against those who have wronged us and caused so much destruction and loss of life. We need to make sure that such a tragedy does not happen again. R believes that all members of Isis should be held accountable, regardless of rank or position. As the respondent, I believe that the individuals in question should be punished for all of their actions and for their involvement in the war. A trial is not enough and I do not know who would sue them. However, I do think that they should have a real trial.', "The respondent emphasized the importance of holding the perpetrators of violence accountable for their actions. They recounted the horrific violence that was inflicted on their family and community, including the death of their husband, their brother in law's daughter being taken captive, and their co-wife's children being taken captive. The respondent also described how Isis brought them meat to cook, but they refused because of the pain of seeing the woman taken away by force. The respondent wants justice for the violence done to them and their family. As the respondent, I agree with the statement that was presented. From the perspective of the respondent, the commander should be held responsible for any wrongdoings as they would have ordered their soldiers to do it. The soldiers themselves are not responsible as they would have only followed orders from their Head. From the respondent's perspective, it appears difficult for the Head to be held accountable, either through judgement or some other means, such as revenge or payment of money.", 'I believe it is vital that those who caused harm to me and my community are held accountable for their actions. As a respondent, I feel frustrated and confused as to why my husband has had to endure so much suffering, hunger, and deportation, when the Yazidi people have done nothing wrong to anyone. I am now left with no knowledge of his whereabouts. From the perspective of the respondent, they believe that all Arabs should be held accountable for the horrible things they have done. R suggests that those responsible for the situation should experience a level of hardship that is greater than what was experienced.']} </br>
