It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.[19] When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can be bright enough for its reflected light to cast visible shadows,[20] and is on average the third-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 64, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}' message='Post details'

If you want a break, tell us, we will make a break.\\n\\tR: Aha OK. Like any other Yazidis, when first ISIS came to Iraq, they came to Shingal. They came and entered Yazidi areas. On the 3rd of August, ISIS came to Shingal, we were in Sinone, and Sinone is a big area populated by Yazidis. We tried to run away, we stuffed our bags and we used our cars. We had a lot of stuff.  We ran to the mountain. We had a lot of sheeps and cows.\\n\\tI: You ran away?\\n\\tR: Yes, we ran away. And we left everything behind, we left our cars. We stayed on the mountain over the night. In the following morning, people said that ISIS would not do anything to anyone; they only needed our properties, money, belongings, and our stuff. Yazidi people believed them. They asked us to go back down to our houses. Yazidi people believed them because Yazidi people are very peaceful. We never want wars. We said that we would go down to take our cars to go the Northern Areas in Kurdistan. We came down and took our cars, we drove down to the Western part of Shingal. There was a village where it took you to Syria then to Iraq again. We should go through that village to Syria, then to Kurdistan. We were on a muddy road to that village, we were about to reach the village. All of a sudden an ISIS car stopped us and parked in front of our car. We were not a lot. We were a lot of Yazidi. A lot of Yazidis were on that road that day. There were cars, tractors, trucks and other vehicles full of Yazidi people. There were even Yazidis who came walking. The ISIS guys asked where we wanted to go, they pointed weapons at us. They asked us to stop our cars, we all did. They asked us where we wanted to go; we said that we wanted to go to Kurdistan. They asked to go back to our houses, they said there was nothing to worry about, and we told them we wanted to go to Kurdistan. They directed us to a way where it led to KhanaSor. When the US army invaded Iraq, the US Army with Iraqi Army built a huge training camp. They told us to go there. They told us that they would take to Syria. We went a bit on that way, and then they told us to stop and return because they said that the way was not good. We we returned, ISIS were with us, we were in our cars, but there was am ISIS car for every two of three of our cars. They were pointing guns at us. They were controlling the crowd from all sides. They took us back to the Training Camp. They told us that we would remain in that training camp until the ISIS leader comes to convert us all to their religion. The training camp was full of Yazidi people; there were elderly people, girls, women, men, and children. They brought us all together. \\n\\tI: Were there men alone?\\n\\tR: No, we were all together. Whoever they captured, they brought them to the training camp. They told us that we had to convert to their religion. There was an airstrike that day. They got all of us on cars again; people said that they would release us. Some people didn\\u2019t have cars; they put them in their cars. Again, we followed their instructions. They controlled us from all sides on the roads. They directed us to a village called Shino. The road leading to it was through mountain. It wasn\'t a big village. They took us all there. Then, they came to divide us. They put girls aside. The ISIS guys were all armed and obliged the girl to convert to their religion. They divided us into elderly, men, women, girl, and women with children groups. Then, they put us in rows. They said that they would kill us. They took men and got them on to cars. After that, they did the same thing with elderly people. The young boys who were not old enough to be with men were left with women. They arranged the crowd into lines and asked them to go to Masjid to covert to Islam. Later that day, at night time, they asked to get in cars. They didn\\u2019t let to get in cars together. There were cars for different groups. There were cars only for girls and some cars for women like us who were with children. We didn\\u2019t know what happened to elderly people. They drove us to the big masjid in Shingal. \\n\\tI: Where did they take you? \\n\\tR: They took us all to the Masjid. \\n\\tI: So you were together? \\n\\tR: Yes, we were together. We didn\\u2019t know what the route was, but they took us together. The crowd of people was shattered among different cities. Some people were taken to Tal \'Afar, some others were taken to unknown places, and we were taken to somewhere very near to SHingal. I didn\\u2019t know where Tal \'Afar was. Tal \'Afar and Mosul were in troubles long ago. \\n\\tI: How many of your children were with you?\\n\\tR: Six of children were with me. The girls were still with us. We knew that they would take them. The ISIS guys were very happy and they were picking girls. They took young girls, women who were alone, and girls who were a bit old. They took the girls and they were disappeared. We didn\\u2019t have our phones with us to contact them. They took us too. They put us in a big hall. They took us there for registration and keeping records of our numbers. They left us there. They took our phones from us. They took al our stuff and belongings. The place a very big hall with nothing in it except us. They were coming and selecting women and girls among. Every one of them took the one he liked. They were also taking young boys away. Some of the children were returned to their mothers, while some others were not. They took both of my sons. After a while, they returned the younger son, and as for my older son, he remained with them for a couple of days, he was returned back as well. We were in the worst situation one could imagine. We were hungry and thirsty. They didn\\u2019t give us food. Sometimes, they brought us some loafs of solid bread, but the most of the times they didn\\u2019t. It was like dying every moment. Many times, I tried to suicide, but then I was saying to myself if killed myself, who would take care of my children. Women around me were shouting and praying for God to kill them. They were asking God save their chidren. Again, they took us to Mosul and they brought us back to the same place where my daughter was taken with girls. Later, they put us in some houses. Once, I told myself that was it, I said that I had enough, so I told the women around me that we had to plan and escape , otherwise we would die there. There were airstrikes; we heard the sound of bombing. While the airstrike was continuing, one every strike, one women sneaked out. Like that, we were sneaking out. Until most of us made to sneak out of the hall. We escaped until we had arrived somewhere.We kept on running until we had arrived the mountain. \\n\\tI: So you escaped? \\n\\tR: Yes, we did. We were running through the fileds of thorns that had streams of water. During night times, we were hiding ourselves in those holes of water under thorny plants. We had some lanterns that we could use them for finding our ways. \\n\\tI: So you running and walking during the day? \\n\\tR: And at night, we were hiding ourselves.  We were starting to run and walk with the crack of the dawn; we stopped only when we saw a car or some people. We kept on running and escaping for days. \\n\\tI: How long did it take you to reach a place?\\n\\tR: It was like three or two days. I don\\u2019t really remember. We spent time in those half-built houses or behind destroyed roads. \\nVIOL2 How long did you spend in captivity?\\tVIOL2 H\\u00fbn \\u00e7iqas di dest\\u00ea DAE\\u015e\\u00ea de man?\\tVIOL2 Wie lange haben Sie in Gefangenschaft verbracht?\\nI: How long did you stay in captivity with ISIS? \\nR: Around one month and some days. It wasn\\u2019t that long. We had arrived at the top of the mountains, the situation there was the worst, but at east we could escape from them. We said if we died, it was better for us to die there on the mountains. We have been througha lot fo difficulties. While we were on the top of the mountains, roads leading to Shingal we blocked. The government was sending choppers to transport people. We barely could get a car, we went to Kurdistan. There in Kurdistan, we were put in Camps, the situation was almost the same. We didn\\u2019t have anything there. We were there alone, all of our girls remained in their hands. \\nI: So your children and you escaped? Right? \\nR: Yes, I didn\\u2019t believe that we made it. I thanked God that I could save my children. While I was in Kurdistan, I was always thinking about what happened to us. It affected my psychology. \\nI: What did you know about your husband?\\nR: I didn\\u2019t know anything about husband. After we escaped, we didn\\u2019t know what happened to them. \\nI: Did they escape as well?\\nR: Yes, they escaped, but I didn\\u2019t how and when. \\nI: Did you escape together? \\nR: No, they escaped a day earlier than us. An Arab man helped my husband to escape, that Arab guy was in the similar situation. \\nI: Who was that Arab guy?\\nR: A man had a lot of bad experience with ISIS; my husband didn\\u2019t tell me a lot about him. After we came, a woman who was my relative was rescued from Mosul and they brought her there. A girl also was rescued; she was called Rozina. We were captured together, but she was rescued after we escaped. After a year or so, one of our daughters came. Another one is on the way. \\nI: Are there any of your relative families still in capitivity with ISIS?\\nR: Yes, a lot. My cousins and their families. They are not first cousins. But they are from our families. Yazidis are all related in a way. They never say that we don\\u2019t know other Yazidis. We feel each other\'s pains because the more you spend time in their captivity, the worse you see. \\nI: Thanks a lot for you for telling us about your experience. Do you want to say something else? \\nR: I swear this is all. I said everything I know. If you ask me anything, then I will answer. \\nVIOL3 What about your escape, would you like to share any information about your escape?\\tVIOL3 Reva we (baze we), h\\u00fbn dixwazin behsa reva xwe (baz dene xwe) bikin?\\tVIOL3 M\\u00f6chten Sie uns etwas \\u00fcber Ihre Flucht erz\\u00e4hlen?\\n", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 150, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}' message='Post details'

If you want a break, tell us, we will make a break.\\n\\tR: Aha OK. Like any other Yazidis, when first ISIS came to Iraq, they came to Shingal. They came and entered Yazidi areas. On the 3rd of August, ISIS came to Shingal, we were in Sinone, and Sinone is a big area populated by Yazidis. We tried to run away, we stuffed our bags and we used our cars. We had a lot of stuff.  We ran to the mountain. We had a lot of sheeps and cows.\\n\\tI: You ran away?\\n\\tR: Yes, we ran away. And we left everything behind, we left our cars. We stayed on the mountain over the night. In the following morning, people said that ISIS would not do anything to anyone; they only needed our properties, money, belongings, and our stuff. Yazidi people believed them. They asked us to go back down to our houses. Yazidi people believed them because Yazidi people are very peaceful. We never want wars. We said that we would go down to take our cars to go the Northern Areas in Kurdistan. We came down and took our cars, we drove down to the Western part of Shingal. There was a village where it took you to Syria then to Iraq again. We should go through that village to Syria, then to Kurdistan. We were on a muddy road to that village, we were about to reach the village. All of a sudden an ISIS car stopped us and parked in front of our car. We were not a lot. We were a lot of Yazidi. A lot of Yazidis were on that road that day. There were cars, tractors, trucks and other vehicles full of Yazidi people. There were even Yazidis who came walking. The ISIS guys asked where we wanted to go, they pointed weapons at us. They asked us to stop our cars, we all did. They asked us where we wanted to go; we said that we wanted to go to Kurdistan. They asked to go back to our houses, they said there was nothing to worry about, and we told them we wanted to go to Kurdistan. They directed us to a way where it led to KhanaSor. When the US army invaded Iraq, the US Army with Iraqi Army built a huge training camp. They told us to go there. They told us that they would take to Syria. We went a bit on that way, and then they told us to stop and return because they said that the way was not good. We we returned, ISIS were with us, we were in our cars, but there was am ISIS car for every two of three of our cars. They were pointing guns at us. They were controlling the crowd from all sides. They took us back to the Training Camp. They told us that we would remain in that training camp until the ISIS leader comes to convert us all to their religion. The training camp was full of Yazidi people; there were elderly people, girls, women, men, and children. They brought us all together. \\n\\tI: Were there men alone?\\n\\tR: No, we were all together. Whoever they captured, they brought them to the training camp. They told us that we had to convert to their religion. There was an airstrike that day. They got all of us on cars again; people said that they would release us. Some people didn\\u2019t have cars; they put them in their cars. Again, we followed their instructions. They controlled us from all sides on the roads. They directed us to a village called Shino. The road leading to it was through mountain. It wasn\'t a big village. They took us all there. Then, they came to divide us. They put girls aside. The ISIS guys were all armed and obliged the girl to convert to their religion. They divided us into elderly, men, women, girl, and women with children groups. Then, they put us in rows. They said that they would kill us. They took men and got them on to cars. After that, they did the same thing with elderly people. The young boys who were not old enough to be with men were left with women. They arranged the crowd into lines and asked them to go to Masjid to covert to Islam. Later that day, at night time, they asked to get in cars. They didn\\u2019t let to get in cars together. There were cars for different groups. There were cars only for girls and some cars for women like us who were with children. We didn\\u2019t know what happened to elderly people. They drove us to the big masjid in Shingal. \\n\\tI: Where did they take you? \\n\\tR: They took us all to the Masjid. \\n\\tI: So you were together? \\n\\tR: Yes, we were together. We didn\\u2019t know what the route was, but they took us together. The crowd of people was shattered among different cities. Some people were taken to Tal \'Afar, some others were taken to unknown places, and we were taken to somewhere very near to SHingal. I didn\\u2019t know where Tal \'Afar was. Tal \'Afar and Mosul were in troubles long ago. \\n\\tI: How many of your children were with you?\\n\\tR: Six of children were with me. The girls were still with us. We knew that they would take them. The ISIS guys were very happy and they were picking girls. They took young girls, women who were alone, and girls who were a bit old. They took the girls and they were disappeared. We didn\\u2019t have our phones with us to contact them. They took us too. They put us in a big hall. They took us there for registration and keeping records of our numbers. They left us there. They took our phones from us. They took al our stuff and belongings. The place a very big hall with nothing in it except us. They were coming and selecting women and girls among. Every one of them took the one he liked. They were also taking young boys away. Some of the children were returned to their mothers, while some others were not. They took both of my sons. After a while, they returned the younger son, and as for my older son, he remained with them for a couple of days, he was returned back as well. We were in the worst situation one could imagine. We were hungry and thirsty. They didn\\u2019t give us food. Sometimes, they brought us some loafs of solid bread, but the most of the times they didn\\u2019t. It was like dying every moment. Many times, I tried to suicide, but then I was saying to myself if killed myself, who would take care of my children. Women around me were shouting and praying for God to kill them. They were asking God save their chidren. Again, they took us to Mosul and they brought us back to the same place where my daughter was taken with girls. Later, they put us in some houses. Once, I told myself that was it, I said that I had enough, so I told the women around me that we had to plan and escape , otherwise we would die there. There were airstrikes; we heard the sound of bombing. While the airstrike was continuing, one every strike, one women sneaked out. Like that, we were sneaking out. Until most of us made to sneak out of the hall. We escaped until we had arrived somewhere.We kept on running until we had arrived the mountain. \\n\\tI: So you escaped? \\n\\tR: Yes, we did. We were running through the fileds of thorns that had streams of water. During night times, we were hiding ourselves in those holes of water under thorny plants. We had some lanterns that we could use them for finding our ways. \\n\\tI: So you running and walking during the day? \\n\\tR: And at night, we were hiding ourselves.  We were starting to run and walk with the crack of the dawn; we stopped only when we saw a car or some people. We kept on running and escaping for days. \\n\\tI: How long did it take you to reach a place?\\n\\tR: It was like three or two days. I don\\u2019t really remember. We spent time in those half-built houses or behind destroyed roads. \\nVIOL2 How long did you spend in captivity?\\tVIOL2 H\\u00fbn \\u00e7iqas di dest\\u00ea DAE\\u015e\\u00ea de man?\\tVIOL2 Wie lange haben Sie in Gefangenschaft verbracht?\\nI: How long did you stay in captivity with ISIS? \\nR: Around one month and some days. It wasn\\u2019t that long. We had arrived at the top of the mountains, the situation there was the worst, but at east we could escape from them. We said if we died, it was better for us to die there on the mountains. We have been througha lot fo difficulties. While we were on the top of the mountains, roads leading to Shingal we blocked. The government was sending choppers to transport people. We barely could get a car, we went to Kurdistan. There in Kurdistan, we were put in Camps, the situation was almost the same. We didn\\u2019t have anything there. We were there alone, all of our girls remained in their hands. \\nI: So your children and you escaped? Right? \\nR: Yes, I didn\\u2019t believe that we made it. I thanked God that I could save my children. While I was in Kurdistan, I was always thinking about what happened to us. It affected my psychology. \\nI: What did you know about your husband?\\nR: I didn\\u2019t know anything about husband. After we escaped, we didn\\u2019t know what happened to them. \\nI: Did they escape as well?\\nR: Yes, they escaped, but I didn\\u2019t how and when. \\nI: Did you escape together? \\nR: No, they escaped a day earlier than us. An Arab man helped my husband to escape, that Arab guy was in the similar situation. \\nI: Who was that Arab guy?\\nR: A man had a lot of bad experience with ISIS; my husband didn\\u2019t tell me a lot about him. After we came, a woman who was my relative was rescued from Mosul and they brought her there. A girl also was rescued; she was called Rozina. We were captured together, but she was rescued after we escaped. After a year or so, one of our daughters came. Another one is on the way. \\nI: Are there any of your relative families still in capitivity with ISIS?\\nR: Yes, a lot. My cousins and their families. They are not first cousins. But they are from our families. Yazidis are all related in a way. They never say that we don\\u2019t know other Yazidis. We feel each other\'s pains because the more you spend time in their captivity, the worse you see. \\nI: Thanks a lot for you for telling us about your experience. Do you want to say something else? \\nR: I swear this is all. I said everything I know. If you ask me anything, then I will answer. \\nVIOL3 What about your escape, would you like to share any information about your escape?\\tVIOL3 Reva we (baze we), h\\u00fbn dixwazin behsa reva xwe (baz dene xwe) bikin?\\tVIOL3 M\\u00f6chten Sie uns etwas \\u00fcber Ihre Flucht erz\\u00e4hlen?\\n", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 150, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}' message='Post details'

If you want a break, tell us, we will make a break.\\n\\tR: Aha OK. Like any other Yazidis, when first ISIS came to Iraq, they came to Shingal. They came and entered Yazidi areas. On the 3rd of August, ISIS came to Shingal, we were in Sinone, and Sinone is a big area populated by Yazidis. We tried to run away, we stuffed our bags and we used our cars. We had a lot of stuff.  We ran to the mountain. We had a lot of sheeps and cows.\\n\\tI: You ran away?\\n\\tR: Yes, we ran away. And we left everything behind, we left our cars. We stayed on the mountain over the night. In the following morning, people said that ISIS would not do anything to anyone; they only needed our properties, money, belongings, and our stuff. Yazidi people believed them. They asked us to go back down to our houses. Yazidi people believed them because Yazidi people are very peaceful. We never want wars. We said that we would go down to take our cars to go the Northern Areas in Kurdistan. We came down and took our cars, we drove down to the Western part of Shingal. There was a village where it took you to Syria then to Iraq again. We should go through that village to Syria, then to Kurdistan. We were on a muddy road to that village, we were about to reach the village. All of a sudden an ISIS car stopped us and parked in front of our car. We were not a lot. We were a lot of Yazidi. A lot of Yazidis were on that road that day. There were cars, tractors, trucks and other vehicles full of Yazidi people. There were even Yazidis who came walking. The ISIS guys asked where we wanted to go, they pointed weapons at us. They asked us to stop our cars, we all did. They asked us where we wanted to go; we said that we wanted to go to Kurdistan. They asked to go back to our houses, they said there was nothing to worry about, and we told them we wanted to go to Kurdistan. They directed us to a way where it led to KhanaSor. When the US army invaded Iraq, the US Army with Iraqi Army built a huge training camp. They told us to go there. They told us that they would take to Syria. We went a bit on that way, and then they told us to stop and return because they said that the way was not good. We we returned, ISIS were with us, we were in our cars, but there was am ISIS car for every two of three of our cars. They were pointing guns at us. They were controlling the crowd from all sides. They took us back to the Training Camp. They told us that we would remain in that training camp until the ISIS leader comes to convert us all to their religion. The training camp was full of Yazidi people; there were elderly people, girls, women, men, and children. They brought us all together. \\n\\tI: Were there men alone?\\n\\tR: No, we were all together. Whoever they captured, they brought them to the training camp. They told us that we had to convert to their religion. There was an airstrike that day. They got all of us on cars again; people said that they would release us. Some people didn\\u2019t have cars; they put them in their cars. Again, we followed their instructions. They controlled us from all sides on the roads. They directed us to a village called Shino. The road leading to it was through mountain. It wasn\'t a big village. They took us all there. Then, they came to divide us. They put girls aside. The ISIS guys were all armed and obliged the girl to convert to their religion. They divided us into elderly, men, women, girl, and women with children groups. Then, they put us in rows. They said that they would kill us. They took men and got them on to cars. After that, they did the same thing with elderly people. The young boys who were not old enough to be with men were left with women. They arranged the crowd into lines and asked them to go to Masjid to covert to Islam. Later that day, at night time, they asked to get in cars. They didn\\u2019t let to get in cars together. There were cars for different groups. There were cars only for girls and some cars for women like us who were with children. We didn\\u2019t know what happened to elderly people. They drove us to the big masjid in Shingal. \\n\\tI: Where did they take you? \\n\\tR: They took us all to the Masjid. \\n\\tI: So you were together? \\n\\tR: Yes, we were together. We didn\\u2019t know what the route was, but they took us together. The crowd of people was shattered among different cities. Some people were taken to Tal \'Afar, some others were taken to unknown places, and we were taken to somewhere very near to SHingal. I didn\\u2019t know where Tal \'Afar was. Tal \'Afar and Mosul were in troubles long ago. \\n\\tI: How many of your children were with you?\\n\\tR: Six of children were with me. The girls were still with us. We knew that they would take them. The ISIS guys were very happy and they were picking girls. They took young girls, women who were alone, and girls who were a bit old. They took the girls and they were disappeared. We didn\\u2019t have our phones with us to contact them. They took us too. They put us in a big hall. They took us there for registration and keeping records of our numbers. They left us there. They took our phones from us. They took al our stuff and belongings. The place a very big hall with nothing in it except us. They were coming and selecting women and girls among. Every one of them took the one he liked. They were also taking young boys away. Some of the children were returned to their mothers, while some others were not. They took both of my sons. After a while, they returned the younger son, and as for my older son, he remained with them for a couple of days, he was returned back as well. We were in the worst situation one could imagine. We were hungry and thirsty. They didn\\u2019t give us food. Sometimes, they brought us some loafs of solid bread, but the most of the times they didn\\u2019t. It was like dying every moment. Many times, I tried to suicide, but then I was saying to myself if killed myself, who would take care of my children. Women around me were shouting and praying for God to kill them. They were asking God save their chidren. Again, they took us to Mosul and they brought us back to the same place where my daughter was taken with girls. Later, they put us in some houses. Once, I told myself that was it, I said that I had enough, so I told the women around me that we had to plan and escape , otherwise we would die there. There were airstrikes; we heard the sound of bombing. While the airstrike was continuing, one every strike, one women sneaked out. Like that, we were sneaking out. Until most of us made to sneak out of the hall. We escaped until we had arrived somewhere.We kept on running until we had arrived the mountain. \\n\\tI: So you escaped? \\n\\tR: Yes, we did. We were running through the fileds of thorns that had streams of water. During night times, we were hiding ourselves in those holes of water under thorny plants. We had some lanterns that we could use them for finding our ways. \\n\\tI: So you running and walking during the day? \\n\\tR: And at night, we were hiding ourselves.  We were starting to run and walk with the crack of the dawn; we stopped only when we saw a car or some people. We kept on running and escaping for days. \\n\\tI: How long did it take you to reach a place?\\n\\tR: It was like three or two days. I don\\u2019t really remember. We spent time in those half-built houses or behind destroyed roads. \\nVIOL2 How long did you spend in captivity?\\tVIOL2 H\\u00fbn \\u00e7iqas di dest\\u00ea DAE\\u015e\\u00ea de man?\\tVIOL2 Wie lange haben Sie in Gefangenschaft verbracht?\\nI: How long did you stay in captivity with ISIS? \\nR: Around one month and some days. It wasn\\u2019t that long. We had arrived at the top of the mountains, the situation there was the worst, but at east we could escape from them. We said if we died, it was better for us to die there on the mountains. We have been througha lot fo difficulties. While we were on the top of the mountains, roads leading to Shingal we blocked. The government was sending choppers to transport people. We barely could get a car, we went to Kurdistan. There in Kurdistan, we were put in Camps, the situation was almost the same. We didn\\u2019t have anything there. We were there alone, all of our girls remained in their hands. \\nI: So your children and you escaped? Right? \\nR: Yes, I didn\\u2019t believe that we made it. I thanked God that I could save my children. While I was in Kurdistan, I was always thinking about what happened to us. It affected my psychology. \\nI: What did you know about your husband?\\nR: I didn\\u2019t know anything about husband. After we escaped, we didn\\u2019t know what happened to them. \\nI: Did they escape as well?\\nR: Yes, they escaped, but I didn\\u2019t how and when. \\nI: Did you escape together? \\nR: No, they escaped a day earlier than us. An Arab man helped my husband to escape, that Arab guy was in the similar situation. \\nI: Who was that Arab guy?\\nR: A man had a lot of bad experience with ISIS; my husband didn\\u2019t tell me a lot about him. After we came, a woman who was my relative was rescued from Mosul and they brought her there. A girl also was rescued; she was called Rozina. We were captured together, but she was rescued after we escaped. After a year or so, one of our daughters came. Another one is on the way. \\nI: Are there any of your relative families still in capitivity with ISIS?\\nR: Yes, a lot. My cousins and their families. They are not first cousins. But they are from our families. Yazidis are all related in a way. They never say that we don\\u2019t know other Yazidis. We feel each other\'s pains because the more you spend time in their captivity, the worse you see. \\nI: Thanks a lot for you for telling us about your experience. Do you want to say something else? \\nR: I swear this is all. I said everything I know. If you ask me anything, then I will answer. \\nVIOL3 What about your escape, would you like to share any information about your escape?\\tVIOL3 Reva we (baze we), h\\u00fbn dixwazin behsa reva xwe (baz dene xwe) bikin?\\tVIOL3 M\\u00f6chten Sie uns etwas \\u00fcber Ihre Flucht erz\\u00e4hlen?\\n", "temperature": 0.7, "max_tokens": 150, "top_p": 1.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0}' message='Post details'
