## Project Overview
The four main questions to see if AI system can answer from all the data are (main themes and common responses):

1. What does justice mean to you?           
2. How much of a priority is it for you to have justice for what happened to you during the conflict with ISIS?         
3. Who should be held accountable?
4. And how should they be held accountable?
